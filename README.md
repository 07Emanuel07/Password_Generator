# Password Generator Project

This Python application generates a secure random password based on user-defined criteria. Users can specify the number of letters, symbols and numbers they want in their password.

## Key Features

**User Input for Password Criteria:**
  - The application prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, symbols and numbers for the password.

**Character Lists for Password Generation:**
  - The application defines lists of characters, including letters, numbers and symbols, which are used to construct the password.

**Password Construction Logic:**
  - The application constructs the password by randomly selecting characters from the defined lists based on the user's input

**Randomization of Password Order:**
  - The application shuffles the order of the characters in the password to ensure randomness and security.

**Final Password Output:**
  - The application concatenates the characters in the password list to form the final password and displays it to the user.
